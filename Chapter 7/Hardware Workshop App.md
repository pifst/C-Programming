** Why Are You Starting Your Company? **
Comfy Ball was conceptualized last fall at Hacking Pediatrics, and was subsequently awarded the best hardware hack.  (article)[http://vectorblog.org/2013/11/the-comfy-ball-a-hack-to-help-children-express-their-pain/].  The project was started by a group of doctors, nurses, and business professionals.  

I joined a month ago (undergrad Mechanical Engineering, masters in CS expected '16); and have since created two prototypes, capable of two-way communication with any modern web browser.

** Describe What your company does: **
The primary goal of the company is to produce assistive healthcare technologies to help patients better understand & communicate illness thru symptom tracking, data analysis.  The first product; the Comfy Ball is designed for children, or people with communication disorders who may have difficulty communicating their pain levels while inpatient inside a hospital.
